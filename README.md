Sometimes you wanna leave Facebook for your own reasons and you decided to delete it permanently but you don't wanna get rid of all those pictures you sent and received while using it, like Twitter and Google, Facebook also has this awesome feature to download a (zip, json in tgis case I'm talking about zip) file with all the files (inbox, contacts, posts, stories ...) meaning a complete copy of your Facebook account. 
so all you need to do is open your browser and go to [here](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permission) .
After that you'll need  to submit and wait for it it will take a day maximum depends on your Facebook account if it's an old account with a lot of groups, and media shared (videos). 
so the script is so basic its just using a for loop to find (messages/inbox/folder/photos) folder then copy of all it's content (pictures) to another folder with only pictures . or use regexp to find some pattens (Emails, Phone Numbers) inside specific conversation
